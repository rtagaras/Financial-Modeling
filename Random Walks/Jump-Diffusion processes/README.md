# Jump-Diffusion Processes

This file demonstrates the calculation of paths for a jump-diffusion process and the distribution of path endpoints. JD.png shows an example. The smooth curve in the second sub-figure gives the endpoint distribution of geometric Brownian motion and is shown for comparison.
