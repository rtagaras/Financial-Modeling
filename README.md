# Financial-Modeling

This is a series of projects of varying size, meant to document my study of the applications of computational methods to finance.

Individual ideas are contained within their own folders; names are hopefully self-descriptive. 

"Multiple Investment Risk" and "Options Pricing" follow "Finance with Monte Carlo" by Ronald Shonkwiler.

"Black-Scholes Vanilla Options", "Vanilla Greeks", and "Delta and Gamma Hedging" follow "The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance" by Mark Joshi.
