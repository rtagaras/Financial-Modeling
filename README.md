# Financial-Modeling

This is a series of projects of varying size, meant to document my study of the applications of computational methods to finance.

Individual ideas are contained within their own folders; names should be self-descriptive. 

"Multiple Investment Risk", "Options Pricing", and "Random Walks" follow "Finance with Monte Carlo" by Ronald Shonkwiler.

"Black-Scholes Vanilla Options" and "Vanilla Greeks" follow "The Concepts and Practice of Mathematical Finance" by Mark Joshi.
