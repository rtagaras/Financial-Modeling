# Financial-Modeling

A series of projects of varying size, meant to document my study of Monte Carlo methods and their application to finance.

Individual ideas are contained within their own folders; names should be self-descriptive. 

This work is currently following "Finance with Monte Carlo" by Ronald Shonkwiler.
